# SykGenData

Welcome to your new gem! In this directory, you'll find the files you need to be able to package up your Ruby library into a gem. Put your Ruby code in the file `lib/SykGenData`. To experiment with that code, run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt.

# Generators

This project was made to be a library resource for generating data.

## Using the generators

1. Clone down the repo and merge this lib folder with your own

2. Add the following gems to your gemfile
```
gem 'yaml'
gem 'json'
gem 'faker'
gem 'httparty'
gem 'rspec'
```
or install them individually.

3. Use the generators by requiring the generator_super ruby and and including the GeneratorSuper module into your class

4. Inside your class use
```
form
```

```
form.get_first_name   # returns a first name
form.get_last_name    # returns a last name
form.get_username     # returns a dbz inspired username
form.get_password     # returns a string with upper and lower case as well as special characters and numbers
form.get_dob          # returns a date of birth as an array of 3 values
form.get_phone_number # returns a phone number starting 07

city.get_city_name_by_id id       # returns a city name by that city's id
city.get_city_names               # returns an array of city names
city.get_random_city_name         # returns a random city name
name = city.get_random_city_name
city.get_city_id_by_name name     # returns a city id by that city's name

postcode
```
to call GenPostcodeData class used to generate UK postcodes for use with an API.

## Testing

The generators are all tested using rspec, you can run the tests for yourself by going to
```
lib/SykGenData/generators
```
from the project root directory and running the command
```
rspec
```


## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
